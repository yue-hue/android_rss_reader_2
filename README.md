# Android RSS reader

2nd lab. BSUIR, 6th semester.

Develop an application with a graphical interface that supports viewing any rss feed. It is necessary to implement parsing xml and displaying a list of news and also displaying the news in detail using UIWebView (that is, the page will open in the application, not the browser)
You can download a news feed both from a file and from the Internet.
